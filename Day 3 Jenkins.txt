Day 3 Jenkins:

java-->maven
dockerfile-->docker build
python-->pip

terraform
ansible-->no build tools

------------------

SonarQube:

What is SonarQube?

SAST tool: Static application security testing

It will go and scan your application code.

-- Try to find any vulernablities are there?
-- If code has any logical issue
-- if code has some password or token in plain-text they will find out
-- If code duplication is there these tool can findout
-- Code smell-->They procativaley find the issue.

To work as code reviewer

==>SonarQube

--> Codeql

--> aws code guru


----------------------
-->code-->build package-->scan code(Sec ops): Vulernability


Stages:

	stage: checkout-->Git repo
	stage: package-->mvn clean package
	stage: verify-->mvn verify
	stage: test package-->mvn test
	stage: sonar cli-->sonar cli on your system
	stage: scaning and publishing the repor-->organization key ,project and token in ci pipeline


Sonar plugin: The plugin they not maintaining 



maven: package tool->maven

sonar: scan/review application code

----------------
docker /containers
dockerfile

Jenkins
------------------------------------------

What is docker? what is containers?


Docker is a opensource tool which provides containerization.

Podman,cri-o

-----------------

What is containers?

Application works?


I need a db (mysql) on my laptop?

-->you will go and install db

-->MySQL 8

Is it possible to run multiple version of MySQL simautaenously on same laptop??

-->MySQL 5 without MySQL 8?

JDK 17-->JDK21



2) Suppose you are running jenkins--dependency 21

another app which require jdk 17

Dependency conflicts

-------------------

Multiple app version, installation challenges must be avoided

Bundle the application in the container: application source code+ run time+Dependency +library +configuration

------------------
Application-->Design to run/install directly on os

Application-->sourcecode+ compile+package+run ==>to put all these activity (assembling process ) to create container image we need

docker/podman-->capability to create container image

To run the containers on the os: you need one application which understand the containerization. That application is called container run time.


Docker is one of the container run time provider.


It is first company which provided a stable soulution for container image and container run time.


Yes, podman,cri-o

Linux foundation: cncf(cloud native computing foundation) -->Kubernetes

OCI--> open container intitative:

How to build the container iamge

how to run  the container image

----------------

installation of docker

Explain docker architecture

-->docker can build container images: Build library (buildkt)
--> docker can run container images: Container run time(Containerd)

docker cli-->request will go to dockerd (Server)

client -server arch

docker cli-->Client

dockerd-->Server


Containerd is the container run time application of docker


Docker engine: docker client+ dockerd + docker api +containerd


------------------

images: container images. Packages which i will use for distribution purpose

os which is stored on dvd...iso image

git project-->uploading to the GitHub

container image-->upload the registry


--Create the start container from the image-->containers


--->search the image on registry

-->download it

-->create the container.
