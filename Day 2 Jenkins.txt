Day2: git activites (using ssh) and maven
----------

What is version control?

maintaining the revision? Why we are maintaining the revision?

developer changes has to tracked? why?

Revert back

----------

version control tool: git (application)

what is GitHub? How will one developer will share the code change with other developer?

Hosting website to host git projects.  (GitHub,gitlab,bitbucket)

------------------------------------------


1) you created a project on GitHub and clone it

2) I will create a project in Linux/windowsbox and convert to git project

3) enable the tracking , i will add and commit

4) git commit  command , will generate a commit id , that commit id is tracking the changes.


--------------------------------------


Clone-->Full download 

Pull-->First time it will download full, after that pull will only download the difference


git repo (a,b,c) suppose u created a new file d

clone-->a,b,c

pull--> firstime ->a,b,c

if you do pull again, it will only download the difference

d
------------------------------
ssh authentication

which works using private and public key pair

private key will be in your Linux box.

public key you will upload to GitHub

whenever you run "git push " command--> it will use private key to encrypt the data, if GitHub has right public key
it will decrypt successfully, u will be authenticated.

-------------------------

ssh-keygen -t rsa

using above command you will create key pair for a specific user in your Linux box.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Build tools:

maven: Maven is build tool to create package from the java source code.


Playstore: package

Build tools create package.

java source code-->Compile (javac)-->interpretor-->ML-->package


Maven-->POM.xml (project object model)

-->carries environment details for code

--> Dependency for packaging.

--> Plugin requirement that pom.xml
-----------------------

What is artifact?

collection of package..

-->output (package) 

-->ansible,terraform (reports)

When you want to store your output, to reuse somewhere else, then it is called artifact.

pacakge-->
report
log

JFrog is one of the artifcatory.

source code-->building package-->Releasing it

java-->maven to build-->Release jfrog

--------------------------------


Jenkins-->Master

single node(build tool is installed)

--------------------


parameters: inputs
