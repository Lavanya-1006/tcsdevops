Day 4 
Containerization:

How application will be running or packaging in containers:

appcode+ run time+dep +lib

containers:

Container images: read only templates for your application

Registry: is a repos, where you keep container images for storing and distribution purpose

docker hub
quay
mcr
ghcr

---

Application:Container runtime: Containerd (docker container run time)

docker cli-->client
dockerd daemon-->server
containerd-->container runtime


docker search nginx--->containerd-->connect to registry (hub.docker)

docker pull nginx

docker images

If i want to create container fom the image,and start the container
 

docker run -d --name mycontainer nginx

containers are not virutalmachine:

vm-->will be having full os kernel

containers are dependent on the host os for kernel calls.


container-->ip address
       ->pid

----------------------------
Image building process

image buiding is not part of container runtime


dockerfile(name of thefile can be anything)


What is in the docker file??

It will be having a set of instruction how to build a container image.

--Using that set of instruction we will be building our container image.

Activity which you want perform.

FROM 
LABEL
ADD
COPY
EXPOSE
RUN
CMD 
ENTRYPOINT
WORKDIR

Instuction are not case sensitive, it is  a practice to distguish between instruction and argument, instruction

should be provided in caps.
--------------
FROM instruction

IF I give you an applicaton code, and I ask you to go and copy it?

abc application, which you need to container image for thJ

Suppose this abc application is webserver code written in php, I need to isnt
FROM : Mandatory instruction to provide the base image

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get install apache2 -y

docker build -t webapplication  -f dockerfile .



----------------

application code-->Devolment box--



Requirement-->Develop a contaimer image where webserver is permeanently installed

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install apache2 -y

docker build -t webapp -f dockerfile .

-----------------

base image==>

from Debian:stable

-->docker build on the docker file

	==>docker pull debain:stable
	==>it creates in temp container
	==> apt-get udate && apt-get install apach2    
       ==>commit create a new image

base+webserver==>newimage


-----------

FROM
CMD
ADD
---------

Whenever my container runs the stuff execte.

Image creation part that particular section should not exeucte

docker build

docker run


date.sh
